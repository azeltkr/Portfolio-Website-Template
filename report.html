    <p>Introduction :</p>
    <p>
      The essential story being told by my portfolio site is the evolution of my
      professional journey as a visionary front-end engineer in the year 2034.
      This portfolio showcases a future version of myself who has significantly
      contributed to the field of web development through cutting-edge
      technologies like AI-driven interfaces, quantum computing, and Web 5.0.
      The audience I'm addressing includes potential employers, clients, and
      industry peers who are interested in my skills, accomplishments, and
      innovative approach to front-end development. I chose a clean, modern, and
      responsive structure that allows for seamless navigation and interaction,
      ensuring that the portfolio is easy to explore on any device.
    </p>
    <p>Inspirations :</p>
    <p>1. Brittany Chiang (https://brittanychiang.com/)</p>
    <p>2. Annie (https://anniebombanie.com/)</p>
    <p>3. Matt Farley (https://mattfarley.ca/)</p>
    <p>
      These three portfolios have inspired different aspects of my own design
      process, teaching me the importance of consistency, creativity,
      storytelling, usability, minimalism, and attention to detail. Each one has
      shown me how to effectively communicate my personal brand while providing
      a seamless and engaging user experience.
    </p>
    <p>Accessibility:</p>
    <p>
      1. Responsive design: My site is fully responsive, meaning it adapts to
      different screen sizes and devices, making it accessible to users on
      desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Keyboard Navigation: All interactive elements on the site can be
      accessed and navigated using the keyboard, ensuring that users who rely on
      keyboard navigation can fully engage with the content.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Alt Text for Images: I've included descriptive alt text for all images
      to ensure that screen readers can convey the content to visually impaired
      users, improving the overall accessibility of the site.
    </p>
    <p>Usability :</p>
    <p>
      1. Clear Navigation: The site features a straightforward navigation menu
      that allows users to easily find the information they are looking for
      without confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Fast Load Times: I optimized images and minimized code to ensure that
      the site loads quickly, enhancing the user experience, especially for
      those with slower internet connections.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Consistent Layout: Each section of the site follows a consistent
      layout, making it easier for users to understand and predict where they
      can find certain types of information.
    </p>
    <p>Learning :</p>
    <p>
      1. GSAP: I had to learn how to integrate and use GSAP to create advanced
      animations that enhance user interaction. I achieved this through online
      tutorials and documentation provided by the GSAP communities.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Responsive Design Principles: I deepened my understanding of responsive
      web design by studying media queries, flexible grids, and fluid layouts,
      which I implemented through trial and error in my CSS.
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Accessibility Best Practices: To ensure my site is accessible, I
      researched and applied best practices such as ARIA labels, semantic HTML,
      and keyboard-friendly navigation.
    </p>
    <p>Evaluation I :</p>
    <p>
      One of the most successful aspects of my work is the dynamic and
      interactive user interface. The animations created using GSAP provide a
      modern, engaging experience that keeps users interested in exploring the
      site. The responsive design ensures that the portfolio looks great on all
      devices, making it versatile and user-friendly. Additionally, the clear
      and intuitive navigation structure helps users find the information they
      need quickly, enhancing the overall user experience.
    </p>
    <p>Evaluation II:</p>
    <p>
      I could improve the site's accessibility by implementing a dark mode
      option for users with visual sensitivities.
